# Java Theme Park App

A Java App created to model a theme park, demonstrating the use of abstract classes, interfaces and polymorphism.

## Objectives
* Practice modelling a large real world domain
* Use abstract classes, classes, inheritance and interfaces

## The app does the following
* Uses abstract classes for Attractions and Stalls and a concrete class for Visitors
* Has child classes for Attractions (i.e. Dogems) and Stalls (i.e. IceCreamStall)
* Uses interfaces to restrict visitors to certains Attractions/Stall based on height and age
* Uses a ThemePark class that contains an array of Attractions and Stalls
